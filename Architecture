Step-by-Step Workflow
Phase 1 — TensorFlow Rust/Crack Detection

Use your DACL10K COCO dataset (rust and cracks).

Train a TensorFlow/Keras model to detect rust and cracks.

Outputs can be bounding boxes or masks.

Test the model on images to make sure it detects defects accurately.

This is your primary defect detection model.

(Optional) You can already overlay results on images or small video clips.

Phase 2 — YOLO Motor Part Detection

Collect a small dataset of motor images.

Annotate the motor parts with bounding boxes.

Train a YOLO model (e.g., YOLOv8) to detect motor parts in real time.

This model is fast and meant for camera detection.

Phase 3 — Real-Time Detection Pipeline

Capture frames from the camera.

Run YOLO → detect motor part → output bounding box.

Crop the bounding box region from the frame.

Pass the cropped region into TensorFlow model → detect rust/cracks.

Overlay results (TensorFlow detection) back onto the full camera frame.

Display in real time.

Phase 4 — 3D Modelling (Later)

Take the TensorFlow outputs (detected rust/cracks on motor parts)

Feed into your 3D reconstruction pipeline.
