**AI/ML-Based Video Analysis for Motor Inspection**

RotorAI is an intelligent system that uses computer vision and machine learning to **detect rust, cracks, and other surface defects** in electric motors from **video footage**.  
It aims to assist engineers and maintenance teams by automating defect detection and providing **3D visualization** of problem areas.

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

1. Collect and preprocess image/video data of motors (normal, rusted, cracked)  
2. Train and evaluate TensorFlow-based models for defect classification  
3. Implement a pipeline for **real-time defect detection** from live video  
4. Map detected areas onto a **3D motor visualization**  
5. Develop a simple **user interface** for monitoring and results display
